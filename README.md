## Node Jsüçè
**why we use?**
1. JavaScript Everywhere: Since it uses JavaScript on both the client and server sides, developers can work in a unified language across the entire application stack.

2. Non-blocking I/O: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient for handling multiple connections simultaneously. This is particularly beneficial for I/O-heavy applications.

3. Fast Performance: Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js compiles JavaScript to native machine code, leading to high performance and speed.

4. Scalability: Its architecture allows for easy scalability, making it suitable for applications that need to handle a large number of simultaneous connections.

5. Rich Ecosystem: The Node Package Manager (npm) offers a vast collection of libraries and tools, facilitating quick development and reducing the need to build functionality from scratch.

6. Microservices Friendly: Node.js is well-suited for building microservices architectures, allowing for modular application design.

7. Community Support: A large and active community means a wealth of resources, tutorials, and third-party modules are readily available.

**These features make Node.js an excellent choice for building web applications, APIs, and real-time applications like chat applications and online gaming.**
